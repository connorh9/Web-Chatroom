# React Based Web Chatroom
This project allows students to input their course load and be automatically placed in a class.
The backend API was made with Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy, while the frontend is done with Javascript and React.

The website is accessible from https://badger-web-chatroom.vercel.app/

-The database used to store the chatrooms and messages is a postgres database being hosted on Supabase due to the convenience of their free tier.   
-The website frontend is being hosted with Vercel mainly due to the seamless integration between git and vercel.   
-Finally, the Flask API is being hosted with Google Cloud Run because of the easy deployment but also free credits.   


## What I Would Add   
This is a project that I started mainly so I could further my skills with React and Flask and learn about websockets and deployment.   
I plan on moving to other projects right now such as my receipt scanner and transit tracker, but If I were to continue with this project,   
here are some things I would add/improve upon.   
1. Webscraping for UW-Madison class names. Right now the website allows users to type anything in for the class. Ideally, they should have to select from a list
2. Better compatibility with mobile phones. While usable on a mobile browser, the website is not meant for it and thus doesn't scale well.
3. A more attractive UI. While I do like some of the features of the UI, it is very bare on purpose, as I wanted to focus on functionality.
4. Account creation. Currently you are assigned a user account from your browser, in the future I would add authentication.
